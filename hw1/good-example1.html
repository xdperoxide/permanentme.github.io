					<h2>Purpose</h2>
					<div>Provide video and audio streaming of live broadcast (audio streaming of news channel is available on mobile apps only), latest news update of video and textual content, news program by special topic, push notification on news update. Review all online content of cultural, technology, business columns.</div>

                    <h1>What and why it is good</h1>
                    <h2>#1 Audio streaming of video content as fallback under unstable network connection. </h2>
                    <p>Under slow or unstable network connection that video content cannot be fully loaded, the app will switch to audio content as a fallback when playing the news content until connection resumes. to User can still view the news content without being interrupted by unstable connection. Instead of displaying error message when the app fail to play video, the app allows user to correct error before it occurs. Audio streaming also facilitates user to receive live broadcast under stable connection and multitasking of device. The audio live streaming will continue in the background when other apps launch on the foreground. User can listen to the live broadcast when they are doing other things at the same time. </p>

					<h2>#2 Use of color contrast to draw user attention</h2>
						<p>The app use orange against dark background or text, which produces an eye-catching effect to draw user attention. Selected tab is orange in dark background at the bottom of the screen. For categories with latest update, an orange badge is shown at the top left corner of the tab with the number of new content. When the app launches user usually focus on the main screen. As the orange badges draw user’s attention, user can notice which category has been updated in last 24 hours without reading the new lists. The eye-catching effect of orange also used on background of news title, icons & labels etc. The orange color chosen contrasts well under both black and white background to indicates the significance of news headlines and functional icons. The app uses light grey to distinguish between time posting the news under the title and the new title or content in black color. Light grey is used to compare between viewed/not viewed content on the news list. Greyed out content makes the displayed items less distinguishable than items in highlight (orange) or normal text color. It also processes meaning as less significant items comparing to items in other colors. </p>

					<h2>#3 Easy navigation control</h2>
					<p>
						The app uses swiping to navigate between contents. We used to hold our phones with one hand in most of time unless we are typing. It is difficult to reach and tap button/icons than swiping from one side to another side. The effective control area increases when user can slide any point on the whole left/right edges. To use the screen effectively when playing video content, the app will switch to landscape layout when user rotates the device. Orientation resumes to the device setting after video ends. User is not burden to change the device setting every time before and after playing video. Rotation and swiping are commonly used gestures to control devices. As user learnt the gestures already, they do not need to recall every time the app launches as well.

					<h2>#4 Consistent layout displaying web content over app</h2>
					<p>The experience of viewing web pages inside the app is consistent to the app layout with a smooth transition between app content and external web pages. Hyperlinks in the content are linked to mobile friendly web pages. The web pages are resized to fit the screen width so user can view the entire content without scrolling from left to right. Control are fixed on the top for switching between web view and app view smoothly. This ensures user are in full control to navigate between internal and external content.</p>

					<h2>#5 Smart control of app 3G/4G network data usage</h2>
					<p>The app warns user with a popup before playing live high definition video streaming. The app prevent consuming too much data network in the following way. When device is connecting to data network, the app will automatically switch to standard definition video streaming. If user select high definition streaming instead, it will display a popup before playing. Autoplay of video if user enables it in app setting (on/off/on only in wi-fi connection). Restrict network consumption is not just for improving user experience on video streaming, but user control over the device. It is hard to monitor the data network usage. Device may notify user when the amount exceeds certain limit, but only after it happens. The above controls prevent adverse outcomes before it actually happens as a result.</p>
